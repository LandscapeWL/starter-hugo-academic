I am a Ph.D. student of Landscape Architecture in Tianjin University. Advised by [Professor He Jie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jie-He-20). Currently, I am working on urban spatial and place computation for [Urban Spatial Humanities and Place Computation Laboratory (SHAPC lab)](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/hejie). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial big data, social media analytics, and geospatial artificial intelligence.
