abstract: An urban built environment is an important part of the daily lives of urban
  residents. Correspondingly, a poor design can lead to psychological stress, which
  can be harmful to their psychological and physical well-being. The relationship
  between the urban built environment and the perceived psychological stress of residents
  is a signiﬁcant in many disciplines. Further research is needed to determine the
  stress level experienced by residents in the built environment on a large scale
  and identify the relationship between the visual components of the built environment
  and perceived psychological stress. Recent developments in big data and deep learning
  technology mean that the technical support required to measure the perceived psychological
  stress of residents has now become available. In this context, this study explored
  a method for a rapid and large-scale determination of the perceived psychological
  stress among urban residents through a deep learning approach. An empirical study
  was conducted in Gangnam District, Seoul, South Korea, and the SegNet deep learning
  algorithm was used to segment and classify the visual elements of street views.
  In addition, a human–machine adversarial model using random forest as a framework
  was employed to score the perception of the perceived psychological stress in the
  built environment. Consequently, we found a strong spatial autocorrelation in the
  perceived psychological stress in space, with more low-low clusters in the urban
  trafﬁc arteries and riverine areas in Gangnam district and more high-high clusters
  in the commercial and residential areas. We also analyzed the street view images
  for three types of stress perception (i.e., low, medium and high) and obtained the
  percentage of each street view element combination under different stresses. Using
  multiple linear regression, we found that walls and buildings cause psychological
  stress, whereas sky, trees and roads relieve it. Our analytical study integrates
  street view big data with deep learning and proposes an innovative method for measuring
  the perceived psychological stress of residents in the built environment. The research
  methodology and results can be a reference for urban planning and design from a
  human centered perspective.
