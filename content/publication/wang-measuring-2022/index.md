abstract: 'The quality of street space plays an important role in promoting urban
  development. Street space refers to public spaces consisting of street elements
  such as plant, roads and buildings. Humans are the main users of street space. How
  to quantify the human perception of the quality of street space and how to explore
  the connection between the quality of street space and street composition elements
  have been major topics of research in various fields. The development of big data
  and computing has offered new technical tools for the quantitative assessment of
  street perception, while space syntax can provide a theoretical complement to fine-grained
  spatial perception studies for streets. Our research introduces a new method to
  evaluate the quality of street space on a large scale based on street space perceptions.
  The Binjiang district of Hangzhou city of Zhejiang Province of China was used as
  the study area to validate our method. A deep learning scoring model was constructed
  using street images of the area. The perception of the street scenes was scored
  on six dimensions: beautiful, wealthy, safety, lively, depressing, and boring. The
  six perceptual dimensions were further divided into positive and negative percep­
  tions. The top 20% of street views with the highest positive perception scores were
  considered high-quality street spaces, and the top 20% of street views with the
  most negative perception scores were considered low-quality street spaces. Finally,
  an overlay of those streets with the highest accessibility identified street spaces
  with the highest probability of travel and the highest or lowest quality for residents.
  These streets are of high priority in the subsequent urban plan. We used multiple
  linear regression to explain the association between the spatial quality of the
  streets and their constituent elements. The results showed that positive perceptions
  were positively correlated with the presence of plants and roads and negatively
  correlated with walls, the ground, water, and fences. Negative perceptions were
  positively correlated with walls and buildings. The present study provides fundamental
  information on the patterns of urban spatial perception. The use of space syntax
  in deep learning can provide methodological support for more refined urban planning
  research and provide a reference for future urban planning that embraces a human
  perspective.'
